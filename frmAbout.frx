 This project takes TCP and UDP messages from other applications
 and routes them to the proper serial port to control Serial port
 devices (ex. Telephone Sytems, Router Console Port)or other device
 on a PC Serial Port.
 
 Control can be one way (App --> COM Port) via UDP packets, or
 Control can be two way (App <-> COM Port) via a TCP connection.
