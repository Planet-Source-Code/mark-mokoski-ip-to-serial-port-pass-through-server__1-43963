'
'   This project takes TCP and UDP messages from other applications
'   and routes them to the proper serial port to control Serial port
'   devices (ex. Telephone Sytems, Router Console Port)or other device
'   on a PC Serial Port.
'
'   Control can be one way (App --> COM Port) via UDP packets, or
'   Control can be two way (App <-> COM Port) via a TCP connection.
'
'   Version Info
'
'   0.1.X   23-FEB-2003
'   First development.  UDP packets working, packet monitor form
'
'   0.2.X   02-MAR-2003
'   TCP connections working (as server)
'
'   0.3.X   05-MAR-2003
'   Cleaned up some small issues. (changed some form references)
'   Added resize code to monitor form and MDI children.
'
'   0.4.X   07-MAR-2003
'   Cleaned up user interface, colors, icons etc.
'   Set some error trapping on COM and IP conections.
'   Refuse addional connections (TCP) once a COM port is in use.
'   Close COM port when no TCP connection present (For local use of port)
'
'   1.0.X   08-MAR-2003
'   Test release.  Works OK via telnet to control Kenwood TS870 radio and
'   MFJ TNC-2 control.
'
'   1.1.X   09-MAR-2003
'   Added App minimized to systray on startup
'
'   1.2.X   13-MAR-2003
'   Cleaned up some Resize isuues in frmMonitor dealing with the
'   child forms (frmPackets).  Added Raw Text, Verbose Text and HEX
'   monitor modes on frmPackets. Some Dead code clean up and renamed
'   Tabs from "Ports" to "Links" ( I think that's more in line with
'   the projects operation!). Added "Connected to" in the frmPackets
'   caption showing remote IP and remote port of connection.
'   Expanded ASCII control character symbols for verbose text mode.
'
'   1.3.X   15-MAR-2003
'   Added menu bar to frmCommSetUP.  Added connection log and view form
'   (frmViewLog).  Added About form (frmAbout). Added Pop-up menu when
'   App is in SysTray (Right click to Popup)
'
'   1.4.X   17-MAR-2003
'   Added some clipboard features (Cut, Select All, Undo Selection, Find)
'   on Connection Log and Monitor forms
'
'   1.5.x   28-JAN-2004
'   Fixed a problem with the "X" to close app while in connections setup
'   Fixed problem with restoring settings on link's 1 to 3
